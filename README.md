# Electric-Motor-Temperature-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Electric Motor Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning predicts permanent magnet (PM) temperature based on sensor inputs like ambient temperature, coolant temperature, voltage, current, and motor speed. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask, the model helps enable predictive maintenance and prevent overheating failures.
